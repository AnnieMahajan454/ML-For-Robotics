Lab 1 – Data Understanding & Variability
---
This is focused on basic data exploration techniques, including summary statistics and variability analysis. Useful in learning to compute mean, median, mode, IQR, and detect outliers using boxplots. The lab used datasets like tips.csv, Vanilla.csv, and StudentsPerformance.csv to visualize distributions and understand data spread before modeling.
